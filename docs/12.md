# [Step 12](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/GitHunt-Lite-Angular/tree/step12)

## Add data to Feed and also a template

In this step we're going to display list of entries.

We could use repositories from the GraphQL API but let's create a template with a static data for now.

Take a look at the commit.

We've made a lot of changes so I'll explain to you what just happened.

Take the `FeedComponent` class at first.

We created an `Observable` that returns an array of objects. 
Each object contains nested object under `repository` with a name and a owner.

Why `Observable.of`?

As follows in the documentation (linked in Resource):

> Creates an Observable that emits some values you specify as arguments, immediately one after the other, and then emits a complete notification.

So what about the template?

`div.card` is repeated and we put `h4` with a name and a owner of a repository in it.
