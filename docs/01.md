## Add bootstrap

We need to install it first:

```
npm install --save bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.4
```

Bootstrap needs to be added to the global scope. We can achieve this by putting the whole relative path of bootstrap's scss file inside `node_modules`.

The path is:

```
node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss
```

We have to go to `angular-cli.json` and add an entry to `app.styles`.

But `angular-cli.json` uses `/src` as a base directory so we have to make the path relative to that directory:

```
../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss
```

This way our App will compile scss into css and use it!
