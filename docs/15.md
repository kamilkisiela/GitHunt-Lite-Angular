## Use .map operator instead of SelectPipe

I showed you how to use `SelectPipe` but you're not obligated to use it.

Now I will show you how to replace the pipe simply with the `map()` operator from `RxJS` library.

Think of RxJS' `map()` as `Array.map()`, it will help a lot!

First, let's remove the `SelectPipe` from the template.
Than we can use `map()` operator inside the class.

As you can see we use the operator to return `result.data.feed` object.

and.. that's it :)
