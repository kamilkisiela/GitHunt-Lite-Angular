## Add prefetching

Here's yet another example I promies in one of the previous steps.

Feed is built as a list of entries. Each entry has a link to comments page.
As you know, comments are being loaded when user enters the page.
But... we can predict if user is going to enter the page. Of course not in 100%.

When user wants to view the comments he moves the mouse cursor over the "view comments" link and then he clicks. We can handle the `mouseover` event and fetch the same query CommentsPage component does.

When we fetch the query it's being saved to the cache and when user enters the comments section the comments and repository data are already there! He sees rendered page imidiately! Isn't this amazing?
