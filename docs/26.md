## Add empty mutation

We're going to create our first mutation!

Take a look at the commit.
I injected `Angular2Apollo` service into the component and used `mutate()` method.

As you can see, `Angular2Apollo.mutate()` returns an `Observable`.

I haven't set any options, leave it as is for now, in this step I wanted to show you what's the method to do a mutation.
