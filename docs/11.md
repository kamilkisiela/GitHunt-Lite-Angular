# [Step 11](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/GitHunt-Lite-Angular/tree/step11)

## Use ApolloModule

Every Angular library exposes `NgModule`. With `angular2-apollo` is the same.

We called it `ApolloModule`.

ApolloModule brings things like: `Angular2Apollo` service, `SelectPipe` etc.

But it's not so important right now, all about those things later today.

To connect your client instance to your app, use the `ApolloModule.withClient`.

That's what we did in this step.
