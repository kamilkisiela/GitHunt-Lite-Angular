## Fetch currentUser

We're going to fetch the currently logged in user.

Take a look at the commit.

I used a newly created query (`profile.models.ts`) called `currentUser` to fetch the login value.

This time, instead of using `AsyncPipe` I subscribed to an Observable to get the `data.currentUser`.

As you probably noticed, I enabled `forceFetch` flag.
It means that each time you fetch a query it gets the a new result from the GraphQL Server, not from the cache if available.
