## Implement routerOutlet

The last point of our `Router implementation journey` is to finally display the route's contents somewhere.

We create a div with a `container` class (it's a bootstrap thing to make it look nicer).

Inside that div we added `router-outlet` component. It's responsible for displaying the route's contents.
