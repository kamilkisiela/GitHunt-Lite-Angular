## Add loading

In Apollo, you can fetch only part of the data using `returnPartialData` flag.

As follows in documentation:

> This specifies whether Observer instances for this query should be updated with partial results. For example, when a portion of a query can be resolved entirely from the cache, that result will be delivered to the Observer first and the rest of the result (as provided by the server) will be returned later.

If that's a case you would see `loading` set to `true` and get partial results. Than if all the data would be delivered `loading` will be set to `false`.


Let's say we want to know when data is being fetched and when it completes.

Take a look at the commit. You can see that I added a `div` with three dots to show that data is loading.
With that you will see when it takes data from the cache and when it fetches data from the server.
