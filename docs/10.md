# [Step 10](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/GitHunt-Lite-Angular/tree/step10)

## Add proxy for /graphql

We chose to work within same origin but the GraphQL endpoint is running at different port. So what's now?! Don't panic!

AngularCLI comes with a useful feature, proxy configuration.

> I linked a short documentation about it in the Resources section

We alse updated npm script called `start` so each time you will run the app proxy configuration will be used.
