## Add a template for NewEntry

It's a big template but you should get it.

Basically I created a form that triggers `submit()` method on submit.
It also contains an input called `repoFullName`, a space for an error and a submit button.

What's interesting there? Definitely `ngModel` directive.

I won't talk about Angular Forms but if you're familiar with AngularJS' `ng-model` than it's basically the same.

The `ngModel` directive requires `name` attribute to be used within the input.
