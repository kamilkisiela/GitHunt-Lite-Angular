## Generate Navigation Component

We're going to create App's component! Besides `AppComponent`...

Angular CLI for the rescue!

To create a Component with CLI use:

```
ng g component <ComponentName>
```

> It's way more powerfull than this, so if you want to learn more visit links in the Resources section.

Back to the tutorial...

Let's create the Navigation Component, it will contain name of our App and few buttons. So run:

```
ng g component Navigation
```

Check `src/app/navigation` directory.

AngularCLI automaticaly added NavigationComponent to `AppModule`.
