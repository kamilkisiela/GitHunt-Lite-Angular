## Use SelectPipe

Since the result of `watchQuery` contains `loading` and `data` fields, how can we use `ApolloQueryObservable` within a template, with usage of `AsyncPipe`?

That's a very good question. Hope the answer would be at least equally good...

This is why we created the `SelectPipe`. It takes one argument which is a name of field you want to get.

Take a look at the commit.

The result of an observable looks something like this:

```ts
{
  loading: true,
  data: {
    feed: [{ ... }]
  }
}
```


In the template we use `async | select: 'feed'`.
