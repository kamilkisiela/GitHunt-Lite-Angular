## Use RouterModule

In previous step we created a route but we still have no router implemented.

As every Angular library `@angular/router` has a `NgModule`.

As you can see, we added it to the imports and we used `forRoot` method.
It means that we provide router configuration for the root module.
You can also define different routes for different modules using `forChild`.

But that's not all we did. We imported `routes` from `./app.routes`.
This way we told to the Router what paths we want to use.
