## Add Optimistic response

We learned how to update queries after the mutation.

If you enabled and used network throttling you saw that the update happens after when we get the response from the server.

But what if it's a simple action and we can predict the result?

Apollo comes to the rescue, yet again!

This feature is called **Optimistic Responses** and it's a part of the thing called **Optimistic UI**.
It's helpful to increase the User Experience of your application.

With this you get the result imidiately after mutation is called.

Take a look at the commit.

I define an object within the `submitComment` field.
I used values from the event and also login of the currently logged in user to provide values for the optimistic response.

### Tip

Use again network throttling in the Chrome Dev Tools to see that query updates imidiately. Isn't it amazing?!
