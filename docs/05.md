## Generate Feed Component

We're going to create the most important component, besides `AppComponent` of course!

It will display list of repositories, so let's call it `Feed`.

We've [already generated](04.md) a component with CLI so try to bring back memories and use command we used previously.

I guess you remember but let's show it again:

```
ng g component Feed
```
