# [Step 27](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/GitHunt-Lite-Angular/tree/step27)

## Fill up the mutation

It's time to specify the mutation and the variables.

Options are pretty much the same as in `watchQuery()` and `query()` methods.

A mutation goes to `mutation` property.
Variables goes to `variables` property.

Back to my example. On the GraphQL server we've got defined `submitRepository`:

```graphql
submitRepository (repoFullName: String!): Entry
```

On the client side we specified that variable and we put the value into `variables.repoFullName`.
