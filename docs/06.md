## Define routes

I won't talk about the Router because it's a workshop about GraphQL.

But! Just a quick overview.

Package is called `@angular/router`. You don't say, what a surprise!

We need the `Router` interface to be sure we did everything correctly.

Let's create the default route that displays `Feed`:

```ts
{ path: '', component: FeedComponent }
```

`path` - Router tries to match current location with one of the paths we defined.
`component` - it's a component that is being displayed

In our case, every location points to page with the Feed.

We will create 2 more path, just wait for it :)
